# odin-admin-dashboard

An 'admin dashboard' project based on The Odin Project's course example that can be found here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png

The goal of this project was to build a page using CSS Grid for the majority of the layout design.

The page has a side navigation bar, header with search bar and personal information, a 'Projects' panel with multiple cards, an 'Announcements' panel and a 'Trending' panel.
